          # Note: The upload script uses content hashing, so assets are uploaded to /contents/:hash
          # This means all PRs share the same dev CDN pool, but that's okay since content is
          # immutable and identified by hash. Changed assets will have different hashes.

            ## ✅ Asset Packs uploaded to dev CDN

            Assets from this PR have been uploaded to the development CDN:
            - **Dev CDN**: `https://builder-items.decentraland.zone/contents/:hash`

            The assets are content-addressed (identified by hash), so they're ready for testing in the Creator Hub by configuring:
            ```bash
            VITE_ASSET_PACKS_CONTENT_URL=https://builder-items.decentraland.zone
            ```

            _Triggered by @${{ github.event.comment.user.login }} with `/upload-assets`_
